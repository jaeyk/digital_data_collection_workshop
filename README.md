# Research Workshop on Computational Tools for Digital Data Collection

* **Instructor(s)**: Jae Yeon Kim and Nick Kuipers
* **Date**: Wednesday, 2-4pm
* **Location**: Zoom

**Description**

The focus of this workshop is on digital data collection using R (most cases), Python, and UNIX command-line tools. Three lecture-style sessions will introduce graduate students to advanced techniques in web-scraping, pdf-scraping, and social media scraping. Three seminar-style courses will provide graduate students with the opportunities to receive feedback on strategies for collecting data. 

The objective of this workshop is practical: graduate students will develop and execute data collections strategies in each of the three thematic modules, with the final deliverable being three complete and clean datasets. As such, we will expect graduate students involved in the workshop to identify resources---e.g., administrative databases, archival documents, social media accounts---that they wish to scrape.
