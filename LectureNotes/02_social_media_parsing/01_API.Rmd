# Objectives

- Learning what kind of social media data are accessible through application programming interfaces (APIs)

**Review question**

In the previous session, we learned the difference between semi-structured data and structured data. Can anyone tell us the difference between them?

# The big picture for digital data collection

1.  Input: semi-structured data

2.  Output: structured data

3.  Process:

    -   Getting **target data** from a remote server

        -   The target data is usually huge (\>10GB) by the traditional social science standard.

    -   Parsing the target data your laptop/database

        -   Laptop (sample-parse): Downsamle the large target data and parse it on your laptop. This is just one option to [deal with big data in R](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2019/07/17/3-big-data-strategies-for-r/). It's a simple strategy as it doesn't require storing target data in your own database.

        -   Database (push-parse): Push the large target data to a database, then explore, select, and filter it. If you were interested in using this option, then check out my [SQL for R Users](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/sql-for-r-users) workshop.

-   But what exactly is this target data?

    -   When you scrape websites, you mostly deal with HTML (defines a structure of a website), CSS (its style), and JavaScript (its dynamic interactions).

    -   When you access social media data through API, you deal with either XML or JSON (major formats for storing and transporting data; they are light and flexible).

    -   XML and JSON have tree-like (nested; a root and branches) structures and keys and values (or elements and attributes).

    -   If HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are storefronts, then XML and JSON are warehouses.

# Opportunities and challenges for parsing social media data

This explanation draws on Pablo Barbara's [LSE social media workshop slides](http://pablobarbera.com/social-media-workshop/social-media-slides.pdf).

**Basic information**

-   What is an API?: An interface (you can think of it as something akin to restaurant menu. API parameters are menu items.)

    -   [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) (Representational state transfer) API: static information (e.g., user profiles, list of followers and friends)

        -   R packages: [tweetscores](https://github.com/pablobarbera/twitter_ideology/tree/master/pkg/tweetscores), [twitteR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/twitteR/twitteR.pdf), [rtweet](https://github.com/ropensci/rtweet)

    -   [Streaming API](https://blog.axway.com/amplify/api-management/streaming-apis#:~:text=Streaming%20APIs%20are%20used%20to,a%20subset%20of%20Streaming%20APIS.): dynamic information (e..g, new tweets)

        -   This streaming data is filtered by (1) keywords, (2) location, and (3) sample (1% of the total tweets)
        -   R packages: [streamR](https://github.com/pablobarbera/streamR)

**Status**

-   Twitter API is still widely accessible ([v2](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/early-access) recently released; new fields available such as [conversation threads](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/conversation-id)).

> Twitter data is unique from data shared by most other social platforms because it reflects information that users *choose* to share publicly. Our API platform provides broad access to public Twitter data that users have chosen to share with the world. - Twitter Help Center

    - What does this policy mean? If Twitter users don't share the locations of their tweets (e.g., GPS), you can't get collect them.

-   Facebook API access has become much constrained with [the exception of Social Science One](https://socialscience.one/blog/unprecedented-facebook-urls-dataset-now-available-research-through-social-science-one) since the 2016 U.S. election.

-   [YouTube API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3) access is somewhat limited (but you need to check as I'm not updated on this).

**Upside**

-   Legal and well-documented.

Web scraping (Wild Wild West) \<\> API (Big Gated Garden)

-   You have legal but limited access to (growing) big data that can be divided into text, image, and video and transformed into cross-sectional (geocodes), longitudinal (timestamps), and event historical data (hashtags). For more information, see Zachary C. Steinert-Threlkeld's [2020 APSA Short Course Generating Event Data From Social Media](https://github.com/ZacharyST/APSA2020_EventDataFromSocialMedia).

-   Social media data are also well-organized, managed, and curated data. It's easy to navigate because XML and JSON have keys and values. If you find keys, you will find observations you look for.

**Downside**

1.  Rate-limited.

2.  If you want to access to more and various data than those available, you need to pay for premium access.
